### _Features Left to Implement_

- Main Page Slideshow: Enhance the main page by adding an engaging image slideshow. This dynamic element will provide an eye-catching visual experience for the users.

- Gallery Page Videos: Enrich the Gallery page by incorporating short videos from various events, such as folklore evenings, engagement parties, and kids' parties. These videos will give users an immersive glimpse into the vibrant atmosphere and experiences offered at the restaurant.

- Discount Popup on Join Us: Upon signing up on the "Join Us" page, implement a feature where a welcoming message with a 10% discount offer for the first booking pops up.

These forthcoming features will make the website more interactive, captivating, and appealing to a broader audience, ultimately enhancing the user experience and encouraging participation in the restaurant's events and culinary delights.

## Solved Bugs

- Navbar Toggle: The toggle for the navbar appeared under the heading instead of next to it due to a spelling mistake in the CSS. "position: absolute" was applied incorrectly, missing the "e" at the end.

- Spelling Mistake: Another spelling mistake had a significant impact on the navbar. "a: hoover;" was used instead of "a: hover;" in the CSS, causing unintended behavior.

- Image Size Issue: Three images for the main page were of different sizes, and efforts to compress and resize them were ineffective. As a solution, the idea was changed, and a "Welcome" section was created instead, which resolved the issue.

- Media Query Issue: When applying the "Form" section under a media query, it unintentionally prevented the background image from appearing on the "Join Us" page, leading to an unexpected display problem.

- Bracket Closing Mistake: Forgetting to close a bracket resulted in various unintended consequences, such as the text not appearing on the screen, the color changing unexpectedly, the text font altering, or text alignment issues. Identifying and resolving these bracket-related bugs was time-consuming.

These experiences highlight the importance of thorough testing and attention to detail during project development.

- The issues reducing my performance scores are that I have a large size images, including background images.
- My mobile scores are lower due to the scaling down of images and text for use on mobile.

- All text has good visibility on the background I chose.
